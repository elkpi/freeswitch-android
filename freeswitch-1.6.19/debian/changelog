freeswitch (1.2~alpha1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial release of FreeSWITCH in new debian packaging.
  * The debian packaging has been completely rewritten from the ground up.
  * We now install to the correct locations outlined in the Filesystem
    Hierarchy Standard (FHS).
  * All modules are packaged separately from the core.
  * We have a handy system for autogenerating the final packaging
    configuration from a consolidated configuration file.
