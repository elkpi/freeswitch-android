broadvoice - a library for the BroadVoice 16 and 32 codecs
----------------------------------------------------------

The BroadVoice 16 speech codec is a 16kbps codec for narrowband (3.5kHz) speech.

The BroadVoice 32 speech codec is a 32kbps codec for wideband (7kHz) speech.

These codecs were developed by Broadcom, and are currently deployed in some popular
VoIP phones. Broadcom have provided reference source code, under the LGPL 2.1
licence. However, this code is not in a suitable form for easy integration with
VoIP applications, and has a number of portability issues.

This library is based on the Broadcom reference code, but has been heavily modified
so that it builds into a proper library, with a clean usable interface, on a
range of platforms.
