This file contains a simple list of TODO items.
More general ideas can be found in the roadmap part of the file HACKING.

(in order of importance)

* parser: &#1234; and &#xA25F; like entities must be unescaped.
* packet filter or a generic xml filter? something like a simplified xpath?
* a separate utf8 validator function can be useful
* utf8 <-> utf16 conversion functions can be useful

anything else? :-)
