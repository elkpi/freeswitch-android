Setting up test data for the supplied suite of test programs.
-------------------------------------------------------------

Some of the tests in the test suite for this package require test data files. These test
data files fall into four categories:

    - Some data files, such as those for some of the FAX tests, are generated by programs
      in the package.

    - Some are freely distributable data files, from various sources. These are supplied
      with the package.

    - Some are test data files from a standards body. These are the copyright material of
      the standards body, and so cannot be distributed with this package. However, most of
      these files can currently be downloaded at no charge from the standards body's web
      site. This file describes which files are needed, and how they may be processed to
      produce the right files in the right places for the tests.

    - The two industry standard sources of test data for DTMF decoders are Bellcore/Telcordia
      and Mitel. Neither of these is either free, or supplied in a form directly usable
      with the test suite. These data sources are expected by several tests, and not just
      the DTMF decoder tests. Sad to say, you are on your own when trying to source data
      for these tests.

For the G.722 tests, obtain the file T-REC-G.722-198703-I!AppII!ZPF-E.zip from the ITU web site,
and place it in this directory. Then run

./unpack_g722_data.sh

For the G.726 tests, obtain the file T-REC-G.726-199103-I!AppII!SOFT-ZST-E.zip from the ITU web
site, and place it in this directory. Then run

./unpack_g726_data.sh

For the GSM 06.10 tests, obtain the file en_300961v080101p0.zip from the ETSI web site,
and place it in this directory. If you are able to run .exe (i.e. MS DOS or Windows)
files you can simply run

./unpack_gsm0610_data.sh

If you are unable to run .exe files on the machine you are using (e.e. you are not using Cygwin,
Mingw, Wine, FreeDOS or something of that sort) you will need to find a machine which will. First,
run

./unpack_gsm0610_data.sh --no-exe

This will leave 6 .EXE files in the etsitetss/gsm0610 directory. Take these to a machine which
can run .EXE files, and execute all of them. This should result in a number of files which end
with .COD, INP and .OUT. Copy these to the etsitests/gsm0610 directory, and run

./unpack_gsm0610_data.sh --no-exe-continue

The remainder of the extraction and repacking of files should then take place.
