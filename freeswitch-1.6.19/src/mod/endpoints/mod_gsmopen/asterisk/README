* CHAN_CELLIAX DRIVER FOR AN EXISTING ASTERISK INSTALLATION
*   (works for Asterisk 1.2.xx 1.4.xx 1.6.0.xx series)
*      (do NOT works for Asterisk 1.6.1.xx series)
**************************************************************
==============================================================
1) To build celliax you need the ALSA development libraries
==============================================================

To build celliax on Linux you need to install ALSA-dev libs

You can do it on Debian/Ubuntu with:
# apt-get install libasound2-dev

You can do it on Fedora/CentOS with:
# yum --nogpgcheck -y install alsa-lib-devel

===============================================================
2) build chan_celliax
===============================================================

go into the celliax source directory, edit the Makefile, 
insert the asterisk version (1.2.x or 1.4.x or 1.6.0.x, 
NOT 1.6.1.x), the location of your asterisk sources, then

# make clean
# make

copy chan_celliax.so in the asterisk modules directory

===============================================================
2) configure chan_celliax and asterisk
===============================================================

edit and copy celliax.conf in the asterisk configuration 
directory

copy ciapalo (or your program that accepts text in stdini) in 
the location defined in celliax.conf (sms_receiving_program)

edit modules.conf and put noload in front of *BOTH* chan_oss.so
AND chan_alsa.so AND chan_console.so

copy asound.conf in /etc/asound.conf

if you enable debug in logger.conf and "set debug 100" on 
Asterisk, you'll get *a lot* of info on celliax inner workings

===============================================================
3) Troubleshooting
===============================================================
Check that you set the correct serial device in celliax.conf
You can check how the device is called on your platform with:
dmesg | grep ttyU
dmesg | grep ttyA

Check that you set the correct audio device in celliax.conf
You can check how the device is called on your platform with:
aplay -l
it will give you the number to put on "plughw:N" in celliax.conf

Check the volume for both play and capture, and that capture 
is activated (press spacebar when alsamixer in capture mode)
alsamixer -c[soundcard_number] -Vplay
alsamixer -c[soundcard_number] -Vcapture
we found good results with capt(31) autogain(on) speaker(75)

If you get double digits (bounces) on DTMFs, check if the capture
volume is too high

The SMSs are managed in Unicode (UTF8) for international characters
compatibility. Check that your console and/or text editor displays
UTF8 characters

If you have bad sound, it's a timing problem. Use a 1000HZ kernel,
or add a timing device (ztdummy or zaptel interfaces)

chan_celliax adds to Asterisk the DIALPLAN application:

          CelliaxSendsms

You can type at the Asterisk CLI 'show application [application]' 
to obtain more specific info on usage.



Enjoy!
