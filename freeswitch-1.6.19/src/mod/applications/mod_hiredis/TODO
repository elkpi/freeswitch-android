1. jsapi interface(mod_verto)
2. add lock for hiredis_profile for destroy vs running commands
3. Look into refactor/cleanup of xml processing
4. Add tab complete for profile names for APIs, and possibly for supported actions(and in theory look into key listing from redis)
5. Add linked list session pvt structure for keeping track of limit incr's on a session by session basis
