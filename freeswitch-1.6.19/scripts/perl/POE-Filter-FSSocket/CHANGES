    Potential fix for default POE modules on debian with perl 5.8.4, but I
        I can't be sure because we can't make the problem happen again.

    reworked the handling of Content-Length based replies to deal with replies
      that don't have \n at the end of their data block
    Updated the curses example (fsconsole.pl)
     - Added command/reply output

    Added some "bullet proofing" in the module to handle bad/unknown input
    Updated the curses example (fsconsole.pl)
    Added debug and strict parsing as part of the bullet proofing
     to enable debug add debug => 1 in your new() and if you want the module
     to croak when it doesn't properly parse something use strict => 1 in the
     new().  Example Poe::Filter::FSSocket->new(debug => 1, strict => 1)
     The default for debug and strict is 0
