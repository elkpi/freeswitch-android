DESCRIPTION
===========

Socket library to interface w/ freeswitch mod_event_socket from Twisted python applications.  Used by WikiPBX for all non-http communication w/ Freeswitch.

Install
=======

See INSTALL

Using/Examples
==============

The WikiPBX project uses this lib heavily, so looking at that code (wikipbx.org) is a good example until more docs are added.


Debugging
=========

Set FREEPY_DEBUG_ON = True in globals.py

TODO: pull this from an environment variable or a config file

Rebulding State Machines
========================

(you only need to do this if you changed an .sm file)

for each .sm file:

java -jar /usr/src/smc/bin/Smc.jar -python -g THE.sm

and loginrequest.sm -> loginrequest_sm.py with the state machine.

TODO: create a Makefile to do this stuff
TODO: use Miro Samek's HSM framework instead of SMC
